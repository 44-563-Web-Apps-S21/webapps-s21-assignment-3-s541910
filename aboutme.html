<h1>Eagle Man</h1>
<p>
<pre>
 American Eagle possesses superhuman strength, enabling him to lift (press) approximately 15 tons under optimal conditions.
 He also possesses superhuman speed, agility, stamina, and sturdiness as a result of radiation-induced mutation. 
 Strongbow's bodily tissues are somewhat harder and more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. 
 However, he is far from invulnerable. While he can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials, he can withstand impact forces that would severely injure or kill a normal human with little to no injury to show for it. 
 He can run at a maximum speed of 65 miles per hour for approximately 5 hours before tiring to an appreciable degree.
