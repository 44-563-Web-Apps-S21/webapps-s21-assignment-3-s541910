  <h4>BASIC</h4>
  <q>BASIC (Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code)[1] is a family of general-purpose, high-level programming
    languages whose design philosophy emphasizes ease of use.<br>
    The original version was designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz and released at Dartmouth College in 1964.
    <br>
    They wanted to enable students in fields other than science and mathematics to use computers.<br>
    At the time, nearly all use of computers required writing custom software, which was something only scientists and
    mathematicians tended to learn.
