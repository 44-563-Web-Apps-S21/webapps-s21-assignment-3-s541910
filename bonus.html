    <h1>The Brown Bear</h1>
    <pre>
        The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is a large bear species found across Eurasia and North America.
        In North America, the populations of brown bears are called grizzly bears. 
        It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in size only by its
            closest
            relative, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly bigger on
            average.
        
        The brown bear's range includes parts of Russia, Central Asia, China, Canada, the United States, Hokkaido,
            Scandinavia, the Balkans, the Picos de Europa and the Carpathian region (especially Romania and Bulgaria),
            Iran,
            Anatolia, and the Caucasus.
        The brown bear is recognized as a national and state animal in several European countries.
        While the brown bear's range has shrunk, and it has faced local extinctions, it remains listed as a least
            concern species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) with a total estimated
            population
            in 2017 of 110,000.
        As of 2012, this and the American black bear are the only bear species not classified as threatened by the
            IUCN.
        
        Populations that were hunted to extinction in the 19th and 20th centuries are the Atlas bear of North Africa
            and
            the Californian, Ungavan and Mexican populations of the grizzly bear of North America.
        Many of the populations in the southern parts of Eurasia are highly endangered as well.
        One of the smaller-bodied forms, the Himalayan brown bear, is critically endangered, occupying only 2% of
            its
            former range and threatened by uncontrolled poaching for its body parts.
    The Marsican brown bear of central Italy is one of several currently isolated populations of the Eurasian
            brown
            bear and is believed to have a population of just 50 to 60 bears.

        <li>We learned that brown bears excavate new dens near their previously used dens.</li>
        <li> Bears likely reduce risk by returning to well-known denning areas rather than pioneering new areas where
            conflicts with other bears could arise.</li>
        <li> On average, female and male bears dug their dens < 2.2 miles (3.6 km) and < 3.7 miles (5.9 km) from their
                previous years’ den, respectively. </li>
        <li> However, one sub-adult male that we followed for three years denned 14 miles (22.9 km) and 34 miles (54.4
            km) from its previous years’ dens.</li>
        <li> Once weaned, male sub-adults are often forced out of their birth area by their mother to prevent inbreeding
            and spend the next few years searching for safe high-quality bear habitat.</li>
        <li> We also found that bears rarely reuse the same den, even though they return to the same area to hibernate.
        </li>
        <li>This is likely because, in the Arctic, most dens collapse the following summer as the ground thaws.</li>
